    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into combinations. In the previous lab, you saw how the order was important when using permutations. Cracking a code is one example, but what if the order doesn't matter, for example, when an engaged couple wants to pick 3 wedding cakes from a list of 15? You'll need to use another technique here, and this is where combinations come in handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide whether or not permutations and combinations are required for a given problem\n",
    "* Use Python to calculate combinations and permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous lab, you remember that we created a factorial function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's use this factorial function to create a function `combination` as well as `permutation`, both holding 2 arguments n and k."
